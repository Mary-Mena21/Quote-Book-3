      <p id="quote1" class="quote"> <h3> 1. Success is No Accident</h3>
        Famous soccer athlete, Pele who appeared to be born with plenty of natural talent, continues this quote by adding “It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing.”</p>
      <p id="quote2" class="quote"></h3>2. Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts</h3>
        This quote by Winston Churchill really puts the life cycle of an entrepreneur in perspective. Failure won’t kill you, if you don’t let it. Experiencing this can give you more courage to try again. Even when you ‘make it’ and raise a lot of money or sell your company, life isn’t over. You might unfortunately, have a much clearer picture of the struggles, but then you get to start again with a new startup, or become an angel investor yourself.</p>
      <p class="quote"></h3>3. Don’t Count the Days, Make the Days Count</h3>
        Don’t worry so much about how long you’ve been doing it. Make today count. Focus on what you can do right now. That advice seemed to work well for Muhammed Ali. It can serve you well too, by keeping you in motion and not worrying about the past or future, of which you have no control over.</p>
      <p class="quote"></h3>4. He Who is Not Courageous Enough to Take Risks Will Accomplish Nothing in Life
        Another great quote by Muhammad Ali. As a founder of a company it is wise to try and de-risk your venture by learning as much as you can and testing as much as you can, step by step. Yet, at some point you will have to take calculated risks. That doesn’t mean you won’t have to deal with fear or doubt. You just have to act anyway.</p>
